# sumhal_vreGI

This repository contains code, notes and other stuff about the Virtual Research Environment "Grazing Intensity". 

The aim of the VRE is to estimate the **grazing intensity** of livestock in an specific area. Data comes from GPS devices located on animals in several protected natural areas of Andalusia. 


## Prepare GPS data 
We used GPS data coming from several kinds of GPS devices:
  - **continuous measurement** (***mc***). The position is registered each 5 mins and stored in a SD-card. Data need to be manually downloaded every three months.
  - **SIGFOX** (***sigfox***) and **GSM** (***gsm***): Position is registered at 30-mins intervals and sent using SIGFOX or GSM technology respectively.
